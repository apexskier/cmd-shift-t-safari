## Caveats

Due to Safari limitations, keyboard shortcut only works when a website's page
content is loaded. This means it won't work from the new tab page, or if your
internet connection is down. For a similar reason, this extension requires
global page access ðŸ˜’.

This is a quick project to play with Apple's Safari Extensions framework, so
don't expect anything brilliant.
