- ✅ 1000 tab history
- ✅ Private browsing ignored
- ❔ Button

## Caveats

Due to Safari limitations, keyboard shortcut only works when a website's page
content is loaded. This means it won't work from the new tab page, or if your
internet connection is down. For a similar reason, this extension requires
global page access 😒.

This is a quick (3 hour) project to play with Apple's Safari Extensions
framework, so don't expect anything brilliant.
